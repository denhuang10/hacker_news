Hacker News is a website started by Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories are voted and commented upon which is similiar to reddit. 

This platform is most popular within the techonlogy and startup space.
The goal is to analyze the data from the website to see which type of post receives more comments on average between Ask HN and Show HN. In addition, I also analyzed if a post within a certain time throughout the day has an impact on the number of ratings on average.
